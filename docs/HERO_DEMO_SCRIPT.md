## 🎬 **Recording Script - "AI Research Agent"**

**Duration:** 25-30 seconds (will speed up to 20s in post-production)
**File name:** `hero-research-agent.mp4`

### **The Story:**
"Watch an AI agent perform comprehensive web research and generate a professional report in seconds"

---

### **Action-by-Action Script:**

```
[0:00] 🎬 START RECORDING (Press F9)
       - Baby Research workflow is loaded and visible
       - All 8-10 nodes are visible on canvas
       - Cursor is off to the side

[0:02] - Zoom out slightly (Ctrl/Cmd -) if needed
       - Make sure all nodes are visible in frame
       - Workflow should look impressive and complex

[0:04] - Move cursor to "Run Workflow" button (top right)
       - Hover over it briefly

[0:05] - Click "Run Workflow" button
       - Input modal appears

[0:06] - PAUSE (0.5 seconds)
       - Let viewers see the input modal

[0:07] - Type in the input field:
       - "Research the top 3 AI coding assistants in 2025"
       - OR: "What are the best AI tools for developers?"
       - Type at normal speed (not too fast)

[0:11] - Click "Run" or "Execute" button
       - Modal closes
       - Workflow starts executing

[0:12] - Watch nodes light up in sequence:
       - INPUT node (green/blue glow)
       - INITIAL_SEARCH node (executing)
       - ANALYSIS node (executing)
       - CONTENT_EXTRACTION node (executing)
       - SUMMARY node (executing)
       - OUTPUT node (final result)

[0:22] - Nodes finish executing
       - Show the final OUTPUT node with results
       - Maybe click on OUTPUT to show the report preview

[0:25] - PAUSE (2-3 seconds)
       - Let viewers see the final result
       - Show the research report if visible

[0:28] 🛑 STOP RECORDING (Press F10)
```

**Note:** The actual execution might take 10-20 seconds. That's OK! We'll speed it up to 2x in post-production to make it 10-12 seconds total.

## 🎨 **Visual Layout (What It Should Look Like)**

The Baby Research workflow has approximately 8-10 nodes arranged in a complex flow:

```
INPUT
  ↓
INITIAL_SEARCH (web search)
  ↓
ANALYSIS (analyze results)
  ↓
URL_CONDITION (check if URLs found)
  ↓
CONTENT_EXTRACTION (extract web content)
  ↓
SUMMARY (generate report)
  ↓
OUTPUT (final research report)

+ Additional nodes for:
- ORGANIZATION (organize data)
- REPORT_GUIDE (format report)
- SEARCH_CONDITION (check if more search needed)
- ADDITIONAL_SEARCH (follow-up searches)
```

**It should look COMPLEX and IMPRESSIVE!** That's the point! 🔥

## ⚡ **Pro Tips for This Recording**

### **Cursor Movement:**
- Move **slowly and deliberately**
- Don't rush the typing
- Let the workflow execute naturally (don't speed it up during recording)

### **Timing:**
- The workflow might take 15-25 seconds to execute - that's PERFECT!
- We'll speed it up to 2x in post-production
- Don't worry if it takes time - that shows it's doing real work!

### **Visual Quality:**
- Make sure ALL nodes are visible in frame
- Zoom out if needed (Ctrl/Cmd -)
- The complexity is impressive - show it off!
- Let nodes light up/animate as they execute

### **If You Mess Up:**
- Just press F10 to stop
- Run the workflow again
- Record 2-3 takes and pick the best one
- It's OK if the workflow takes time - that's realistic!

### **Post-Production:**
- We'll speed up the execution to 1.5x-2x
- Add text overlays: "Searching web...", "Analyzing...", "Generating report..."
- Final GIF will be ~20 seconds
- File size: ~5-8MB (perfect for web)
